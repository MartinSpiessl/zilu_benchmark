# zilu_benchmark

This repo contains all the benchmark programs in ZILU evaluation.

zilu takes a program in cfg format.
The cfg is a simple form to decompose loop programs, which keeps zilu from parsing c/c++ program.
Later, we may deveop tools to parse c/c++ program automatically, but for now, most of the transformation work is done manually.
